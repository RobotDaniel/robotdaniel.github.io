## the dev tools menu

The menu is split up into many tabs:  
`Inspector` and `Console` are the main ones we will be using  
`Inspector` lets you view the html of a page and edit the changes live  
`Console` allows you to view logs and use `JavaScript` commands

## using Inspect
I will be using `example.com` for this example but this will work on any website or html document

- Step 1  
open the dev tools
- Step 2  
I would recomend making sure that this icon is highlighted

this icon allows you to hover over an element and then click on it to jump to it in the inspect menu

## document design mode
- step 1
open the `Console` tab 
> insert screenshot here
- step 2 
type `document.designMode = "on" ` and press enter
> insert gif here

this enables document design mode, you can now start editing a page by simply clicking text, you can also delete elements by selecting them
