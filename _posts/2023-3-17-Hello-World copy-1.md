A calculator where 9+10 = 21

this project was inspired by the meme [9+10=21](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/9-10-21/)  
this simple python calculator does exactly that, (9+10=21)



## How it Works
an `if` statement checks if `firstNumber == 9.0 and operation == 1 and secondNumber == 10.0`  
if the following parameters are true, it runs the `ninePlusTen` function, which adds 2 to the original addition     `print(float(firstNumber)+float(secondNumber)+2)` therefore being true to the meme
