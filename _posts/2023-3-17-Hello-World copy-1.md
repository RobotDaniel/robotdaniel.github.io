A calculator where 9+10 = 21

this project was inspired by the meme [9+10=21](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/9-10-21/)  
this simple python calculator does exactly that, (9+10=21)

## how it works
and `if` statement checks if `operation == 1 and firstNumber == 9.0 and secondNumber == 10.0`
if the following parameters are true it runs the `ninePlusTen` function, this function adds 2 to the original addition, therefore staying true to the meme
